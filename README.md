# Turing-Machine

## Introduction

This is a university project of 2018, written in C without any external library

## Task

The project task was to implement an universal single tape acceptor Turing machine.
Given an input file with the Turing machine structure and a list of strings, the program should output a file with, for every string, a 0 or a 1 if the given Turing machine accepts or not the input string


## Thoughts

Good opportunity to use RB trees
Making recursive the algorithm to accept the string was the worst idea ever for space complexity
